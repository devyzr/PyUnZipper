## What is this? ##

I often receive multiple zip files where there is inconsistent naming, for example, the zip is named after the directory it contains, another one contains multiple directories, another contains a single generically named directory which collides with the contents of other zips, etc.

This type of situation makes **Right Click > Unzip All** have inconsisten results.

This unzipper will check that the zip contains a single root directory and that it matches the zip-name and extract it there, otherwise it will create a folder named after the directory and extract the files there.

It is not a perfect solution, but it works for my needs.
